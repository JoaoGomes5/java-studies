# Notes


# SQL

	- We can use alias on select and form statements
		example:
		
		select 
			s.name as Destrito, 
		    	c.name as Cidade, 
		    	region as Região
		from states s, cities c
		where s.id = c.state_id
		
## JOIN 

	
		
	- Inner Join - 
		 
		 example: 
		 	
		 	select 
				s.name as Destrito, 
			    c.name as Cidade, 
			    region as Região
			from states s
			inner join cities c 
				on s.id = c.state_id
